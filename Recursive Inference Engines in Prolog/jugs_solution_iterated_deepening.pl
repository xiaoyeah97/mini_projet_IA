   * January 2019:  modularisation;  documentation improvement
   * March 2019:  higher-order predicates

__USAGE__

Type in:

==
> swipl
?- consult('jugs_solution_iterated_deepening.pl').
?- solve(6).
==

Try

==
?- solve(2).
==

then

==
?- solve(10).
==

Then ';' repeatedly to view all the solutions in increasing order of complexity.
   
What do you observe?  How can you deal with duplicates?
