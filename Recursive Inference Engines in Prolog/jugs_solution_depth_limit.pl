__HISTORY__

   * 2014:  first version
   * January 2019:  modularisation;  documentation improvement
   * March 2019:  higher-order predicates

__USAGE__

Type in:

==
> swipl
?- consult('jugs_solution_depth_limit.pl').

==

Try 

==
?- solve(12).
==

then ';' repeatedly to view *all* the solutions!

Then, try

==
?- solve(8).
==

next

==
?- solve(6).
==

and finally

==
?- solve(4).
==

What do you observe?
