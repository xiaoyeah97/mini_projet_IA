__HISTORY__

   * 2014:  first version
   * June 2019:  modularisation

__USAGE__

Type in:

==
> swipl
?- consult('jugs_solution_memoing.pl').
?- solve.
==

then ';' to see the various solutions.

Stop resolution at various number of solutions and look at the memoing memory ('memoing(X, Y)').  
What do you observe?

Check that you have a mapping indeed with 'findall(X, memoing(X, _), LX), length(LX, NL), list_to_set(LX, SX), length(SX, NS).'.
Run to the end the solver.
Can you retrieve the whole search graph in 'memoing'?
Yes?  How?

/* ANSWER TO THE LAST QUESTION

Not totally since we keep only the shortest paths.

'findall((X, Y), memoing(X, [step(_, Y)|_]), G), forall(member((X, Y), G), (write((X, Y)), nl)).' extract some edges.
